# StormworksModdedVehicleDownloader
A python app to download modded stormworks vehicles since you cant do that on the workshop. Uses github gist to fetch the vehicle.xml and overwrite it to the dummy workshop item.

## How to use?

On first startup you will be prompted to select the stormworks workshop location.
The end should look like this *Steam\steamapps\workshop\content\573090*

Then the next step is to paste the steam workshop URL to your creation. It will be a dummy creation so the vehicle you post on the workshop won't matter. But still set a thumbnail and add the required mods using the "Add/Remove Required Items" button.

Now you can use the github gist to upload your vehicle, make sure the file name is "vehicle.xml".
When its uploaded copy the RAW link and paste it into the second field.

Press the big button.

Once the app is done doing it's thing, you can refresh your workshop list ingame and check the creation. It should now be the vehicle that was pasted on github gist.
